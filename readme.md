### gothrift is a performance optimization framework

###### This is thrift's performance optimization program, which only optimizes performance and does not change functionality. It is perfectly compatible with official thrift and can be switched at will.

###### In some cases, it can improve serialization performance by more than 6 to 7 times, and significantly reduce memory allocation. At the same time, it optimizes the network transmission strategy and improves the overall transmission efficiency.
